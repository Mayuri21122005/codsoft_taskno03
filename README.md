**This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality.

HTML (Structure):
HTML provides the basic structure of the calculator. The calculator is created with several div elements and buttons representing the numbers, operations, and a display screen.
The display area shows the userâ€™s current input and the result after calculations.
Buttons are assigned for digits (0-9) and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), along with a clear button (C) to reset the input.
CSS (Styling):
CSS is used to style the calculator, giving it a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.
The layout is made responsive to ensure the calculator looks good on various screen sizes (e.g., desktops and mobile).
Colors, margins, padding, and fonts are customized to make the calculator visually pleasant, and the buttons have hover effects for better interactivity.
JavaScript (Functionality):
JavaScript handles the core functionality, including the logic for performing calculations.
When the user clicks on the buttons, JavaScript listens to the click events and updates the display accordingly.
The eval() function or custom functions might be used to calculate the result based on the input string.
The clear button resets the input, while the equals button performs the calculation.
